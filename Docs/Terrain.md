# Terrain

As terrain some basic canyon formation is used.
The canyons should be big enough so that planes can fly through them.
It does not need to be hand crafted, generated geometry is fine.

No overhangs, a simple heightmap fully defines the collision.

## Clouds

Clouds are gameplay relevant.
They obscure vision, negatively impact manoeuvrability of planes and missiles.
