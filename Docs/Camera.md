# Camera

Camera movement and rotation is always smooth.

Plane movements are exaggerated by slight camera movement.
Camera lags behind plane movement indicating inertia.

Mappings:
- Right stick: looking around
- Y button (hold): looking at target

## Looking Around

The camera orbits the plane, angle is determined by the amount the stick is moved.
Fully moving the stick to the left / right orbits the camera 180°, looking behind.
Fully moving the stick up / down orbits the camera 90°, looking up / down.
Horizontal and vertical movement can be combined.

## Looking at Target

The camera looks at the currently selected target.
The camera is moved so that the centre of the plane lies between the camera and the target.
